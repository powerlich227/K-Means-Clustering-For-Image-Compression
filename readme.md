Type python assignment5.py "filename" "k_value" and enter in the terminal

For example,
python assignment5.py Koala.jpg 2
it will output image named "compressed_image.png" in the same folder
The max iteration of finding cluster center is setting as 5

All the code is running in python 2.7.16 and MacOS 10.14.16
It might be wrong in python3 because of the use of "sys.maxint"
Just replace it as sys.maxsize
